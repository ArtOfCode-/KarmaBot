This should be a list of a bugs to fix or features to develop

### Bugs

- **work plugin**: unpause should check that the user is in pause
        

### Features

- Games: Some small interactive games to play with Karma and other users.
        - **Roulette** Bet points to get points
        - **Russian Roulette** Karma sends a message to which users can reply to participate. Once playercount is established, a "gun" is loaded and Karma asks one of the users to pull the trigger. Loser looses points?
- **Arithmetic** calculate sums, subtractions, multiplications, etc.
        - Maybe Regex it so it contains no letters and then execute it as code? Can Python do this? [J_F_B_M]
        - I had more in mind something like $>sum 1 3 and that should return 4 [BP]
- **Work** 
    - Prints time when unpause and work stop
- **HQN** Karma checks the HQN and prints the questions of WB that reach the HQN.

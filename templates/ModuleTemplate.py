# The commands listed in this file can be read and loaded as a Module into a MetaModule by the load_module() function

# Add necessary import to this file, including:
# from Module import Command

# import SaveIO # For if you want to save and load objects for this module.
# save_subdir = '<subdir_name>' # Define a save subdirectory for this Module, must be unique in the project. If this is not set, saves and loads will fail.
# SaveIO.save(<object>, save_subdir, <filename>)  # Saves an object, filename does not need an extension.
# SaveIO.load(save_subdir, <filename>)  # Loads and returns an object, filename does not need an extension.

# def on_bot_load(bot): # This will get called when the bot loads (after your module has been loaded in), use to perform additional setup for this module.
#     pass

# def on_bot_stop(bot): # This will get called when the bot is stopping.
#     pass

# def on_event(event, client, bot): # This will get called on any event (messages, new user entering the room, etc.)
#     pass

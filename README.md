SE-Chatbot
==========

A chatbot for the Stack Exchange chat rooms. Mainly for the chat.meta.stackexchange.com chat room Shadow's Den, but can also be used in other rooms.

Setup
=========
Before you can use the bot, you need to install some dependencies such as ChatExchange and BeautifulSoup4.

You'll also need to rename `SecretSpellsTemplate.py` to `SecretSpells.py`. Spells are a Shadow's Den feature, but as they are secret, I only post a template here, not the real spells.
